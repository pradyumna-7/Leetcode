## Problem Overview:
Given two strings `s` and `p`, the task is to find **all the starting indices** of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. The output should be a list of indices where the anagram of string `p` appears in string `s`.

### Approach:
We will use the **sliding window** technique along with **character frequency counting** to solve this problem efficiently.

### Steps:
1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the length of the string `s` is smaller than the length of the pattern `p`, we can immediately return an empty list because it's impossible for `s` to contain an anagram of `p`.
   
2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - We maintain two frequency arrays `countS` and `countP`, each of size 26 (for the 26 lowercase English letters).
     - `countP` stores the frequency of each character in the string `p`.
     - `countS` stores the frequency of characters in the current sliding window of size `m` (length of `p`) within the string `s`.

3. **Initial Window Setup:**
   - We first populate the `countS` array for the first `m` characters of `s` (i.e., the first window of size `m`).
   
4. **Sliding Window:**
   - We then slide the window one character at a time from left to right:
     - **Add** the character that enters the window (on the right).
     - **Remove** the character that exits the window (on the left).
     - After updating the window's frequency counts, we compare `countS` with `countP`. If they are identical, it means the current window is an anagram of `p`, and we record the starting index.
   
5. **Check for Anagram:**
   - We compare the `countS` and `countP` arrays to check if the current window is an anagram of `p`. If they match, we add the starting index of that window to the result list.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int[] countS = new int[26];  // Frequency count for string s (current window)
        int[] countP = new int[26];  // Frequency count for string p
        int n = s.length();
        int m = p.length();
        
        // Edge case: if pattern is larger than the string, return an empty list
        if (n < m) return result;
        
        // Fill the frequency array for p
        for (char c : p.toCharArray()) {
            countP[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Initialize the frequency array for the first window in s
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            countS[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Check if the first window is an anagram of p
        if (anagram(countS, countP)) result.add(0);
        
        // Sliding window: iterate over the rest of the string s
        for (int i = m; i < n; i++) {
            // Add the new character to the window (right side)
            countS[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            
            // Remove the old character from the window (left side)
            countS[s.charAt(i - m) - 'a']--;
            
            // Check if the updated window is an anagram of p
            if (anagram(countS, countP)) result.add(i - m + 1);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    // Helper function to check if two frequency arrays are equal
    private boolean anagram(int[] countS, int[] countP) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (countS[i] != countP[i]) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
