## **Approach:**

The goal is to determine which recipes can be prepared using the available supplies and other previously prepared recipes. The approach is as follows:

1. **Initialization:**  
   - Create a `Set` called `sups` containing all the initial supplies for quick lookup.
   - Create an empty `List` called `output` to store the recipes that can be prepared.

2. **Iterative Process:**  
   - Use a boolean flag `added` to track if any new recipe was added in the current iteration.
   - Loop until no new recipes can be added in an iteration (i.e., until `added` becomes `false`).

3. **Checking Each Recipe:**  
   - For each recipe, check if it has already been added to the `output`. If not, proceed.
   - For each ingredient required by the recipe:
     - If any ingredient is not present in `sups`, the recipe cannot be prepared. Break the loop.

4. **Adding Recipe:**  
   - If all ingredients are available, add the recipe to `output` and also to `sups` so it can be used for other recipes.
   - Set `added = true` to indicate that at least one new recipe was prepared in this iteration.

5. **Return the Result:**  
   - Once no new recipes can be prepared, return the `output` list.

## **Code:**

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<String> findAllRecipes(String[] recipes, List<List<String>> ingredients, String[] supplies) {
        // List to store all the recipes that can be prepared
        List<String> output = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Set for quick lookup of available supplies
        Set<String> sups = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(supplies)); 
        boolean added = true;
        
        // Keep looping until no new recipe is added in an iteration
        while (added) {  
            added = false;
            
            // Iterate through all recipes
            for (int i = 0; i < recipes.length; i++) {
                // If recipe is not already in the output list
                if (!output.contains(recipes[i])) {  
                    boolean canMake = true;
                    
                    // Check if all required ingredients are available
                    for (String ingredient : ingredients.get(i)) {
                        if (!sups.contains(ingredient)) {
                            canMake = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    // If recipe can be prepared, add it to output and supplies
                    if (canMake) {
                        output.add(recipes[i]);
                        sups.add(recipes[i]);
                        added = true; 
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return output;
    }
